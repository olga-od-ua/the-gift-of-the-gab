# The Gift Of The Gab

[Live project can be viewed here](https://olga-od-ua.github.io/CCC-MS1-2020---master)    <<<<!!!!!!!!to change!!!!!!!!!>>>>

The Primary goal of the website is represent and promote The Gift Of The Gab School that offers English language courses to anyone travelling to Ireland whether for a holiday or a lifetime. 

Irish accents are notorious for being hard to understand even for some native English speakers so this school is aiming to help their every customer feel comfortable in any conversation with an Irish person.

The website will provide all the basic information about the school's offers, its team, prices and contact information. Apart from the General English Course the school also offers Business English Course and Hospitality English Course. There are also Intensive Course plans available. The website offers a knowledge test that any user can take to understand their level of competency. Users will be able to print the test results and/or send them to their email address.

**The Strategy Plane**

THE RESEARCH PHASE

Ireland is a country that has welcomed many different nationalities over the past many years and continues to do so, whether it is for business, educational or personal needs, whether for a short- or long-term stay or for a permanent settlement. According to the latest census, there are over half a million non-irish nationals among almost 5,000,000 people living in Iriland. "In April 2016, there were 535,475 non-Irish nationals living in Ireland, a 1.6 per cent decrease on the 2011 figure (544,357). The proportion of the population who were non-Irish nationals has also fallen from 12.2 per cent in 2011 to 11.6 per cent in 2016. This fall in non-Irish nationals can in part be explained by the rise in the number of those with dual Irish nationality, who are classified as Irish in the [census](https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp7md/p7md/p7anii/)."

As English is the main language in the bigger part of The Republic of Ireland, practically all the non-irish nationals residing in Ireland are expected to know the language on a fluent level. After conducting a survey we have found out that before arriving in Ireland the non-English speakers would have learnt English at schools or have taken courses in their countries. The survey showed that they were arriving in different areas in the Republic and almost equally found it very difficult to understand local accents and dialects, as well as slang which differs greatly from county to county and at times even from town to town.

1. The primary goal. 
The Gift Of The Gab Enlish courses are designed to help those moving to Ireland make their language adaptation journey smooth and enjoyable. The Gift Of The Gab teachers are extremely knowledgeable about all the traps and obstacles the students can expect once they land their feet on the Irish soil, whether those traps and obstacles are linguistic or cultural.

2. The website will present all the basic information about the school and will have a few interactive features, i.e. the knowledge test, contact form, school brunches location on Google maps, print options and more. In future releases the school is planning to make studying materials available on the website as well as the online booking of classes.

3. The business objectives of the website are set to attract new customers and promote The Gift Of The Gab School.

4. The customer's estimated needs are to get a quick and easy information about what The Gift Of The Gab School has to offer and how/whether it can help them reach their goals. For those interested in their level of English language knowledge, the quick knowledge test will help get the result free of charge. A quick questionnaire will also help users with the choice of the course and its intensity. Businesses can also request their customised offer through the website.

HOW THIS PROJECT IS DIFFERENT FROM COMPETITORS AND SUBSTITUTES

While there is a plethora of English language courses available in Ireland, neither of them are aiming at teaching specific accents nor helping their customers to integrate culturally. The Gift Of The Gab school knows how important it is to feel comfortable when speaaking a foreign language, let alone when your interlocutor speaks with a strong accent and/or uses a lot of local slang.

The website will have easy-to-follow information with intuitive experience for the user. The users' main questions will be answered upon the first landing on the Home page where the website's main sections will be presented in the form of button-links that will bring the user to discover more once the user cliks on the topic they are interested in.

**The Scope Plane**

The website is planned to have three main releases as identified in the table below in order to unfold new experiences for the users in the future. 

<<<<!!!!!!!>>>>>>>

Trip to Blarney raffle will acquire a more interactive visible for the user form.

The implementation of online lessons and excercises will attract more customers in the future, the customers who prefer online independent education without human interaction.

This website can be sellable as it will have unique studying materials.

**The Structure Plane**

The website has the nav bar that will feature six linear menu elements representing the six self-explanatory main sections of the project, namely:
- Home
- Course Info 
- Knowledge Test 
- Pricing
- About Us
- Contact

The footer will appear on each of the tabs and will have the following information to hand:
- Partners and Sponsors 
- Social networks 
- Contact details  
- Copyright 
	
Home page will have the main sections of the website presented on link-buttons for user to choose where they want to move next.

In the PC version, the navigation is presented by the Nav bar with inline elements. In future releases the nav bar items will have room for subcategories. In the mobile version the navigation will be presented by the Burger Icon. In the future releases the burger icon will have room for additional layers.
